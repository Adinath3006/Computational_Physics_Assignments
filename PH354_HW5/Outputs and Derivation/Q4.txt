Exercise 4

Part A

We know that using the hit or miss method we can evaluate the integral by I = kA/N, here our region of interest is x ∈ [0,2] and
y ∈ [0,1], hence the area A is 2. The expected error on the integral is given by sqrt((I*(A-I))/N).

The value of the integral evaluated using the hit-or-miss method is 1.4544 with an error of 0.89079 %

Part B 

Using the mean value method the integral is evaluated through the formula I = ((b-a)/N)*Σf(xi) for N points, where again the expected
error in the integral is given by ((b-a)/N)*(sqrt(N*var_f))

The value of the integral evaluated using the mean value method is 1.45131 with an error of 0.52757 %

Hence we can see that the integral evaluated using the mean value method is more accurate than hit or miss method which is apparent from 
the error in the integral as 0.52757 % < 0.89079 %.
