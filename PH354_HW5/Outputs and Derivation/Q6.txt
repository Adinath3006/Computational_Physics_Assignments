Exercise 6

Part A 

Refer the Outputs directory for the derivation, 'Q6_deriv.pdf' 

Part B

Using the formula I = 1/N * Σf(x)/w(x) * ∫w(x)dx, we also know that the integral ∫w(x)dx = 2

The value of the integral computed using importance sampling method is 0.83901. Which is very close to the actual value of the integral
0.84
