Exercise 9

The number of dimers in the first simulation (without cooling) is: 938
The number of dimers in the second simulation (with slow cooling) is: 1067
The number of dimers in the third simulation (with fast cooling) is: 1038

We can clearly see that cooling rate affects the occupancy of dimers, slower the rate larger the number of dimers occupied in the lattice
when compared to faster cooling rates. Also we can see that cooling increases the number of dimers in comparison to non cooling method.
This is all attributed to the fact the cooling makes the system less likely to remove the dimer hence increasing the overall occupancy
of the dimer in the lattice.
