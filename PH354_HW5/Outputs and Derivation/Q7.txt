Exercise 7

T = 1
The value of the total magnetization at T = 1 in run 1 is -400
The value of the total magnetization at T = 1 in run 2 is 400
The value of the total magnetization at T = 1 in run 3 is -400

T = 2
The value of the total magnetization at T = 2 in run 1 is -356
The value of the total magnetization at T = 2 in run 2 is -356
The value of the total magnetization at T = 2 in run 3 is 388

T = 3
The value of the total magnetization at T = 3 in run 1 is -96
The value of the total magnetization at T = 3 in run 2 is -94
The value of the total magnetization at T = 3 in run 3 is -36

We can see that the for T = 1 case the system has attained a perfect alignment of all magnetic domains. And the value of the magnetization
is sometimes positive and sometimes negative which is due to the fact that the initial state of the lattice influences the final results,
i.e., if there were more number of negative domains then the magnetization is likely to attain a negative value and vice versa. Thus 
this result is equally likely. Going forward to T = 2, we can see that the system is not completely aligned, which is accounted by the
decrease in the value of 1/T thus increasing the probability of the system being in higher energy state. This is even more apparent
in the T = 3 case where even after 1 million steps the system still is in disorder of domains.
