Exercise 5

Part C 

We can see that from the plot of different masses the heavier mass travels the furthest and lowest at a given time instant when 
compared to other masses. This can be atributed to the fact that the drag force is inversely proportional to mass, thus the lighter
mass 'feels' greater drag force when compared to other masses.
