Exercise 2

Part B 

From the plots we can see that the population of rabits and foxes show periodic behaviour.

The maximum population of fox is always lower than that of the rabits, this is atributed to the fact that we have values of alpha and 
delta in so that foxes die twice as quickly as rabits reproduce, thus even though rabits die as quickly as the fox reproduce, the 
reproduction factor of the rabits outweighs all of them and hence leaving them with a higher maximum population. Additionally when the
rabits reaches maxima then foxes have more food thus the fox population starts growing and rabit population starts dropping, similarly
when the foxes have maximum population they don't have enough food as the population of rabits are lower at this instant, hence the 
population of foxes starts dropping whereas rabbits start growing thus the maxima of both population will never be in phase.
