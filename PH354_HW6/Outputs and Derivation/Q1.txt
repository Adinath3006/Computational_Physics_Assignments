Exercise 1

Part B 

In the presented plot, it is observed that when RC = 1, the output waveform is considerably lower in magnitude than V_in, whereas for 
lower RC values (i.e., RC = 0.01), the waveform closely resembles V_in. This plot serves as evidence that by adjusting the product of 
resistance and capacitance in the circuit, we can regulate the strictness of our low-pass filter. This is in accordance with the concept
that the primary purpose of a low-pass filter is to permit lower frequencies to pass through while obstructing higher frequencies.
