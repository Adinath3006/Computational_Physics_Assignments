Exercise 11

Part A

The approximate solution obtained in 21 iteration is 2.2113468372787014e-17
The approximate solution obtained in 4 iteration is 6.634040517639403e-17
The approximate solution obtained in 6 iteration is 1.1056734215419297e-16

Energies of the corresponding states are:
The ground state energy is 138.02141351655123 eV
The first excited state energy is 414.0642409118671 eV
The second excited state energy is 690.1070693944035 eV

The results are in accordance with the theoretical values of the corresponding energy levels. This is verified from the fact that the 
difference in energy levels between:

First excited energy level - Ground state energy level = 276.042827395316 eV
Second excited energy level - First excited energy level = 276.042828482536 eV

We can see that this difference is linear and has high degree of precision.

Part B

The approximate solution obtained in 10 iteration is 2.312796032263229e-16

Anharmonic Oscillator
The ground state energy is 205.30182913386093 eV
The first excited state energy is 735.6730638026728 eV
The second excited state energy is 1443.5337422747791 eV

Part C 

We have used the method of integrating upto -10*a to 0 but not over that as we might get underflow of values and leading to breakdown 
of code, so we compute the integral in above range and complete the wavefunction according to it nature, i.e., even or odd
