Exercise 8

Part B 

h = 0.01 --- t = 2s
h = 0.001 --- t = 7s
h = 0.0005 --- t = 17s

We can see that the accuracy of the results got better progressively and the time of computation increased expontentially, for h = 0.01
we got a breakdown of code, and h = 0.001 we have an orbit but not a closed loop orbit, h = 0.0005 we get an accurrate result but with
a large computation time

Part C 

t = 2 s

The adaptive rk4 method was much quicker and gave out accurate results almost instantaneously, the scatter plots shows the variation 
of step size for different region. So even though very low step size in fixed step rk4 might give better results, adaptive rk4 will give
reasonably accurate results in a very short time.
