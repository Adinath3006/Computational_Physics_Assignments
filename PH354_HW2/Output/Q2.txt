 SIMPSON'S METHOD 

The approximate value for the integral using the Simpson's method with 10 slices is  4.400426666666667
The fractional error on numerical integration (Simpson) with 10 slices is 9.696969696972666e-05
The approximate value for the integral using the Simpson's method with 100 slices is  4.400000042666668
The fractional error on numerical integration (Simpson) with 100 slices is 9.696969893724372e-09
The approximate value for the integral using the Simpson's method with 1000 slices is  4.400000000004267
The fractional error on numerical integration (Simpson) with 1000 slices is 9.697293473271367e-13

 TRAPEZOIDAL METHOD 

The approximate value for the integral using the Trapezoidal method with 10 slices is  4.50656
The fractional error on numerical integration (Trapezoidal) with 10 slices is 0.024218181818181812
The approximate value for the integral using the Trapezoidal method with 100 slices is  4.401066656
The fractional error on numerical integration (Trapezoidal) with 100 slices is 0.00024242181818179273
The approximate value for the integral using the Trapezoidal method with 1000 slices is  4.4000106666656
The fractional error on numerical integration (Trapezoidal) with 1000 slices is 2.4242421817452255e-06

Thus we can see that for both methods as we increase the number of slices the accuracy of the integral improves. Also for each every 
numver of slices the error in the integral is very less in the case of Simpson's method when compared to Trapezoidal method
