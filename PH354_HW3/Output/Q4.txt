Exercise 4

Roots computed using fixed point iteration are x = 0.636383990038212 and y = 1.999928171652484
Roots computed analytically are x = 2 and  y = 0.4
Thus we can see that even after 100 iterations the roots don't converge to the analytic value hence this method is not very efficient.

Thus the solution otained by rearranging the equations:
Roots computed using fixed point iteration are x = 2.0 and y = 0.4
Roots computed analytically are x = 2 and  y = 0.4
This completely agrees with the analytic solution
